## Objective

Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the Expo Framework for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

To successfully complete this task, ensure you have the following:

    Node.js LTS installed
    VS Code (our recommended IDE)
    macOS, Linux, or Windows
    Expo Go installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for completing the upcoming projects efficiently.
Instructions

By now, you should already have Node.js LTS, VS Code, and a compatible operating system installed. This task focuses on setting up Expo Go on your physical device.
Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 â†’ iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.
Steps to Install Expo Go

    Visit the official Expo Go homepage: https://expo.dev/go.
    Select the latest SDK version.
    Click on Install for your device:
        Android: Install from the Google Play Store.
        iOS: Install from the Apple App Store.
    Open the Expo Go app on your device.
    Create a new account or log in if you already have one.

Document your setup process and any challenges faced in the README.md file. This will help you track your progress and troubleshoot any issues that arise during development.`
